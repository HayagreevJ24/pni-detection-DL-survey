# Perineural Invasion Detection Using Deep Learning: A Survey

## Preface

- Perineural Invasion (PNI) is the infiltration of tumor cells into the perineurium, a bundle of three layers surrounding nerve tissue. PNI is a significant finding given its positive association with recurrence and metastasis in various types of cancers (Prostate, Head and Neck, Pancreatic, etc.) 
- Unfortunately, due to the histological variations in nerve tissue and their minute scale, PNI identification from whole slide images is a painstaking process. Various studies have shown significant intra and inter-observer variability in PNI diagnosis. 

**Motivation**: In the current era of significant development and growth in deep learning techniques, medical imaging applications are benefitting. Deep Learning can mimic Pathologists' thought processes and extract useful features to look for PNI in *digitized whole slides*, WSIs. Biopsy samples are sectioned into slides, stained, and scanned using a high-resolution microscope. 

In light of this, I have authored a comprehensive survey paper titled **Perineural Invasion Detection Using Deep Learning: A Survey**, investigating these areas:

1.   Introduction and Molecular mechanisms of PNI: Reason behind a deep learning implementation. 
2. Summary of approaches - Segmentation, Detection, and Classification (This field contains just 6 articles to date. The paper thoroughly reviews all of them). 
3. Issues governing dataset access and dimensionality, and sources of data. 
4. Pre-processing of WSIs. 
5. Types of deep learning architectures in use and the intuition behind them, training details.
6.  Evaluation metrics, a comparison between the 6 articles' performances, error analysis on dev set.
7. Areas of future research.
